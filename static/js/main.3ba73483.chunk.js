The application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate. Thumbs up! I like how the final scores shows up in the local storage. The only caveat is that if I failed a question when the timer is below the deduction mark it sets the timer to a negative which falls below zero. So in line 194 you can set a conditional statement that returns zero if the time is less than 10sec.
