Your code indentation is well organized and readable and that is a plus in development. The application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate. Thumbs up! I like how the final scores shows up in the local storage. The only caveat is that if I failed a question when the timer is below the deduction mark it sets the timer to a negative which falls below zero. So in line 194 you can set a conditional statement that returns zero if the time is less than 10sec. Make sure to follow the repository structure which is moving js and css files into the assets folder    Nice work generating descriptive commit messages and readme. Keep the good work up!
