# React Bootcamp PortfoliOMG - We're Almost Done with Class!!!

## Technology Used
*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Node.js<br>
* Express<br>
* React


## User Story
Now that I've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, I'm updating my  portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.
